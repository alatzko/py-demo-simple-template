# Python Template Rendering 101

This repo contains a very simple python script that illustrates the bare-basics needed to load a YAML data file and render it with a Jinja2 template.  The "subject matter" was taken from a blog post by Ethan Banks, [here](http://ethancbanks.com/2014/04/11/how-to-simple-juniper-srx-rate-limiting-via-policer/).

Be sure to read more from Ethan on his blog site, [The Peering Introvert](http://ethancbanks.com/) and on [Packet Pushers](http://packetpushers.net/).
